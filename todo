investigate sanity of how youre showing views (in memory)

save game state
send it to /admin on every move

pair me with a bot, see this in the admin panel
communicate turns between me and bot


	
a 'join' view / routine 
a header ('id/station/bank') + 'points' in this round

"start game" from admin 
bots are a prototypical series of actions; 'brains' gaussian distributions
something interesting about when to display heightened heartrates
remember to stop the game after `n` rounds

	entrust amount should be a number dial

refactor
validate user inputs
	ajax to check id uniquness  on  join
	'entrust amount' should be w/i range
	'entrust nothing' 

order some arduino parts

survey is part of this:
	ONE object with all the questions
	yields form AND schema for storing it

try tape

remember visions ->
	bots play turns, and a way to visualize that
	games is current state - old turns, save then forget them
	server emits a Start Game message




adminscreenspecs:
	[id] - [station] - [round #]
		[player:waiting..]
		[bot: {turn}]




specs:

	ID / station / bank 

	total points == points in this round
	updates live

	total points -> bank after each round

	we want to know all their decisions
	including their bank

	for each round: 
			1 row:
				unique ID
				station #
				round #
				how much did i entrust
				how much did bot entrust
				did i c or d
				did bot c or d
				1/0 condition variables
				heartrate value
				bank value
				TIME beginning/end

	survey module in the same system (after everything)



the client/server API :  

	from server
		opponentReadyForNextTurn:
		opponentEntrustTurn:
			&decision: entrust
			&pointsEntrusted: 5
		turnSummary:
			summary: whatever whatever 
			bank: 50

	to server
		cooperateTurn:
			decision: cooperate
		entrustTurn:
			&decision: entrust
			&pointsEntrusted: 5
		readyForNextTurn:


game state:

	id: { 
		human:{bank, points, entrustTurn, cooperateDefectTurn, stationNum}
		, computer:{bank, points, entrustTurn, cooperateDefectTurn } 
		, round: round_num
